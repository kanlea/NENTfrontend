Restaurant API for NENT frontend task

To run the application
- clone the git repo to your computer
- enter the src folder using 'cd src'
- Check if you have node and npm 'node -v' and 'npm -v'
- if not, install node and npm to your computer
- then install the dependencies 'npm install'
- build the project 'npm run build'
- start the application 'npm start'
- go to the web and find your localhost:3000

Features implemented

The Restaurant API web app design rationale
- The design of the web app is suppose to be simple, hence the one page web app where the user can filter and call the data from the restaurant database.
- The color tone is suppose to be warm to make it feel cozy like a restaurant (goes with the theme).
- The UI was designed first in figma, then implemented as designed. can be found in /src/image/UIdesign.png

Possible improvement
- Improve run time performance
- Improve code architecture

Future work
- Add test cases to check whether the application connect correctly
- Give initial design layout or constraints 


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
